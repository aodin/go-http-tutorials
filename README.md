If you're an experienced programmer looking to learn Go, I recommend starting with [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). If you're new to programming, check out [this list of learning resources](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Learn).

1. [A simple HTTP server](/01_handler/)
1. [Requests](/02_request/)


Happy hacking!
